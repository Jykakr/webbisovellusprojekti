            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Jyri Rosle-Krekilä. I am a bowyer.
            I make traditional wooden bows. I also make arrows and
            other traditional archery equipment. I have been making
            bows for about 6 years now. I have made about 20 bows,
            I wish the number being higher, but I have been busy with other things.
            I have made bows from different woods, ash, maple, beech, service berry,
            bird cherry, bamboo and bamboo backed jatoba. I specialize in making longbows,
            but I have made a few recurves too. I also make arrows and strings as well as 
            I have made Mary Rose style arrow and bow bags.
            </p>
            <p>
            I have been researching bow desings and construction almost daily,
            in order to improve on my bows performance. I love finding out every bit
            of knowledge I can, about how every little detail affects the bows performance.
            I started first with English longbows, because I was given the impression,
            that they are the best bows. Then I found out it wasn't so, and I started
            to almost despite them because I felt betrayed and lied to, and I turned out
            to be a fan of asiatic "horse bow" designs.
            </p>
            <p>
            That's when I started the interest of finding out what excactly makes
            them better, all I heard from every one was that the ridgid "ears", the siyahs,
            make the bow faster because of leverage. It wasn't enough explanation for me,
            so I started to research it. I found out what affect the leverage has on the
            bow. I found out that if the siyah has forward angle, it will make the bow 
            as a shorter bow, until the bow is drawn to the point where the string angle
            to the siyah starts to open up, when the siyah starts to offer lever assistance,
            the bow will start to act as a longer bow. As we know, any bendy obyect will be
            stiffer if shortened and vise versa. So the bow will be stiffer at the beginning
            of the draw and will get more flexible as the draw progresses. This causes the
            bow to store more energy at the beginning of the draw than same draw weight
            straight bow. This made me believe that asiatic bows are always better, but
            I have since found out that the truth is not so simple.

            <h2>Longbow, not as simple as you taught</h2>
            <p>
            First I would like to point out that the word longbow, refers to multiple types of bows, 
            there i no one single type of longbow. Most of the text here is about English longbow 
            and similar, but same laws of physics apply to all types of bows. 
            </p>
            <p>
            
            Back to the topic. After I made more research on longbows, I found out that they are not as simple
            as I thought. I taught that they are supposed to form perfect part of a circle
            while drawn, but I found out that they are not. I found out that the best longbows
            are not perfectly round, but they have elliptical tiller (the way the bow bends),
            they are thicker in the middle and thinner at the ends. That means the bend should
            not be circular, because the the thicker wood in the middle can not bend as much
            as the thinner wood at the ends without taking set (permanent bend caused by minor
            compression damage). Set worsens the bows ability to react to changes, it also
            makes the bow weaker. So for the same draw weight, the bow needs to be thicker,
            which in terms means heavier, and as such slower, thanks to the extra mass the
            stored energy has to move around. Not only that but the set also usually causes
            the bow to have string follow (meaning the tips are behind the handle when unstrung),
            which means the bow has less pretension, hence less early draw weight (stored energy).
            </p>  
            <p> 
            Additionally the elliptical tiller makes the bow more efficient, because the stored
            energy is more focused closer to the tips, which means it has less limb lenght to move
            around, and the tips can be lighter, hence faster. The elliptical tiller also makes
            the bow more evenly stressed, which reduces the risk of excess set. It is often said
            that longbows are slow, because they don't have leverage, but leverage it self is not
            actually that beneficial to the bow. The bow as a mechanical devise, cannot generate
            more energy than what is stored into it. The leverage actually makes the tips and thus
            the string more difficult to move. Think of it this way, if you take a heavy hammer,
            it takes less effort to swing it if you hold it near the head, than at the end of the
            handle, it is the same for the bow, the leverage is actually fighting against the stored
            energy. The leverage is only beneficial if the lever is actually lighter than the
            bending limb. This is also confirmed in the traditional bowyers bible series, as it
            also states that mollegabet bow (type of longbow that has long levers) is not faster
            than conventional bow, unless the levers are lighter.
            </p>
            <p>
            One might ask then why does the 
            asiatic bows have levers, if they are not beneficial? The answer is that they are
            not wooden bows, but composites of horn, wood and sinew, which in fact is heavier
            material than wood alone, so the wooden siyah is actually lighter than the limb would
            be if made from the composite material to the tip. Additionally, making siyahs from just
            wood, allows the use of smaller horns to make the bow, increasing the range of suitable
            horn sizes for bow construction, especially in areas where large horned animals are not
            available.
            </p>
            <p>
            Overall, what straight longbow looses in stored energy, compared to asiatic bows, it
            saves in moving mass, which eavens out the field, and makes the bows perform surprisingly
            similarly. On average, asiatic bows are faster, but not neserrily because they are better,
            but because they are often made better, possibly because not many people actually realise
            how to make a good longbow. I fact, asiatic bows that doesn't have forward angle in the
            siyahs, perform often the same, sometimes even worse than longbows, depending on the
            build quality of the bows. The asiatic bows that have forward angle in the siyahs, have
            the potential of being faster, but again, it depends on the build quality. Forward angle
            siyah bows are also more difficult to make, because the forward angle brings instability
            and the bow can actually unstring itself if become twisted. Backward angled siyahs,
            so called non contact siyahs, are more stable, but with the cost of lacking the higher
            energy storage potential.
            </p>
            <p>
                So how fast can a longbow be? Well, I have made a longbow that is 71" long, 51# at 28"
                draw, and it shoots 183 fps with 530 grain arrows. That is pretty fast for any traditional
                bow, even for a commercial modern material recurve. Usually the commercial bows that
                reaches those speeds are either super recurves, or asiatic bows with much longer
                draw lenght than the 28" standard. The bow I made is not even a perfect example of
                what a longbow can be at its best, because it is made to be similar to "viking" bows,
                for example Hedeby (or Haithabu) bow, which is a bow found from, and named after a
                viking age settlement in Denmark. My bow is fire hardened and has a flat belly, which makes it
                better at compression than the "viking" bows, but still not the most ideal longbow. 
                The best historical longbow desing in my opinion is Norwegian military style bow, which
                is like elongated paddle bow, with short wide limbs and long narrow handle. The handle
                also bends some and the lenght of it adds draw lenght, the wide limbs allow for more
                bend close to the tips, which was the more efficient location for it, as mentioned earlier.
                The bow also includes narrow and light tips, for low moving mass. Bows like this have
                allegebly been able to surpass 200 fps with 10 gpp arrows. I have not made a bow like
                this yet, but I am planning to make one (hopefully several) in the future. Have to be 
                added tough, that those bows were laminated, so they were not made from single piece of
                wood, but from compression pine backed with birch or elm. This gives the bow more
                advance over simple self bow, and bows made from different desings and different
                materials have also allegebly been able to reach over 200 fps. I use the word allegebly,
                because I have not seen any of those bows in person, and I have not seen any chronograph
                videos about them, so I have to take the word of the people who made them.
